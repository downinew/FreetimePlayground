# FreetimePlayground

Welcome to the github page for my game I call: FreeTimePlayground / FreeTimeGame / FTG (for short)

I'll try to keep this game as updated as possible and continue to implement new features and fixes to the existing code.
However, being that this is a side project it will not take up a majority of my time as I am currently a full time student at Rose-Hulman and a Division 3 athlete. 

Now more about this game.

Being that I have friends who do not have a current generation console. I wanted to create a game that we could all play together as well as have whatever we want included in the game.

## Some of the features I have planned for this game include:

  -First Person Shooter
  
  -Personally Created Models and Animations
  
  -Interesting and fun maps
  
  -Fully Functional Code Base
  
  -Weapons, Vehicles, Tools
  
  -Possible Looting (for later development ideas)
  
  -TONS AND TONS MORE!
  
## Notable Details

Currently I do not have anything note worthy here.
